**About**
My first project as a developer, comments and reviews will be appreciated :)

I tried to make it in a single file without having to download any audio/images.
:heavy_exclamation_mark: **TIP**: The music can become annoying after a couple of minutes, the bottom left button :loudspeaker: icon toggles the background music.
Also, the game is designed for children, so I recommend setting the difficulty to hard/ insane.

**Features:**
 * Singleplayer and multiplayer modes
 * Mouse and keyboard controls
 * Rick and morty theme toggle
 * Difficulty settings
 * Keyboard controls settings
 * Randomly plays audio when players score
 * Music sound controls


**Future updates:**
* Bootstrap glyphicon fix
* Random game events (portals, powerups etc.)
* Additional audio files to be played when players score
