**About**

My first project as a developer.

I tried to make it in a single file without having to download any audio/images.

:loudspeaker: icon toggles the background music.

Also, the game is designed for children, so I recommend setting the difficulty to hard/ insane.

**Features:**
 * Singleplayer and multiplayer modes
 * Mouse and keyboard controls
 * Rick and morty theme toggle
 * Difficulty settings
 * Keyboard controls settings
 * Randomly plays audio when players score
 * Music sound controls


**Future updates:**
* Random game events (portals, powerups etc.)
* Additional audio files to be played when players score
